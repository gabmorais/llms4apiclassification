This repository contains the data used in and produced by our experiments, serving as supporting material for
reproduction and further analysis

## Models selection

The folder [`models_selection`](models_selection) contains the analysis we conducted till the final LLMs selection. It
comprises the Excel
files we used for models identification, selection of models candidate, and final selection.

## Experiment setup and installation

Complete guidelines to download and install the models locally are available in the [`install`](install) folder, as well
