# Greet the Participants
We started by welcoming the participants. Then, we introduced ourselves and asked the participants to do the same. 

Following the introduction, we explained the purpose of the focus group and obtained the participant's consent to participate.

## Setup
We adopted a retrospective-like approach based on Scrum-Agile practices, a method familiar to the participants. Therefore, we distributed a set of "Post-its" and pencils of different colours to all participants. They should use the "Post-its" to express their ideas. 

A whiteboard was used to fix the "Post-its" for enhanced manipulation. 

## Execution
Estimated duration: 60 minutes.

The focus group was executed through a set of scoped questions to which the participants should write down their thoughts and ideas on the provided "Post-its." Then, they fixed the "Post-its" on the whiteboard. Following, they all discovered the "Post-its," and together, they grouped them by similarity.

After grouping the ideas, a volunteer explained the main idea of each group to the others. At that point, participants could ask questions and complete the idea descriptions.

Once all the ideas had been explained, the participants had five votes to give to any ideas on the whiteboard. 

Following the vote, we established a rank of the ideas, meaning their priority.

Regarding equality of top concerns, a new vote round was proposed.

We also explained the rules outlined below, which framed the focus group process, to the participants.

1. Wait for the focus group leader (the researcher) to signal before starting to write down the ideas.

2. Ensure that you understand the question and wait your turn if you wish to ask a question.

3. Be polite, respectful and objective in your comments.

4. Respect the timeframe allowed to write your ideas.

5. Respect the timeframe allowed to explain your ideas.

6. Respect the number of votes you receive.

## Focus group for "Problem Selection"
Real duration: 36 minutes

The goal of this focus group was to list and rank the challenges they faced to identify the problem to be addressed in our study. We started by doing a summary of the findings from the previous interviews. At that point, we presented the trends, goals, and concerns that had been identified. We have previously composed a list of challenges we identified to submit to the group for selection. Therefore, we have previously fixed the challenges on the whiteboard to enhance the focus group execution.

Then, we followed the steps below.

First, we asked the participants to complete the list if any new facts arose in between. Then, they identified the group in which the new fact should be put. As no new fact emerged, we passed to the next step.

Second, we asked the participants to vote (5 votes per participant for a total of 30 votes) on the most significant challenges, i.e., that should be addressed first, which we fixed on the whiteboard. 

Third, we counted the votes and identified the top three challenges. After compiling the votes, we noted that the top challenge (19 votes) had received at least one vote from each participant, demonstrating unanimity on its priority.
