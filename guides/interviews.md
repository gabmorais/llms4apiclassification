# Greet the Participants
We started by welcoming the participants. Then, we introduced ourselves and asked the participants to do the same. 

Following the introduction, we explained the purpose of the interview and obtained the participant's consent to participate and record the interview.

## Interview
We conducted the interview using the open questions below. We asked the participants to be precise or clarify points in their answers when needed. The goal was to let the stage to them as long as possible without interruption to capture a more significant amount of "natural" information.

The participants could complete the answers to each other when the questions pertained to operational activities. 

## Interviews for "Problem Identification"

This interview round focused on understanding the case context through the challenges faced by the participants.

## Questions asked during "Problem Identification"

1. Could you briefly introduce your team?

2. Could you briefly introduce your role within your team?

3. Could you briefly describe a typical day in your role?

4. Which challenges do you consider the most significant in your role?

5. Which of these challenges has the most significant impact on your job? Why?

6. Could you share a recent experience related to this challenge?

7. How do you foresee the evolution of this challenge? Would it remain, or is it an occasional, transitory challenge?

8. Is there any other subject you think is essential to share and that has not been mentioned yet?


## Interviews for "Requirements Definition"
During this interview round, we presented the participants with the possibility of applying machine learning algorithms, such as LLMs, to address the identified challenge.

### LLMs Demographics
We started by asking participants about their LLMs' literacy.
1. Have you already developed a machine-learning algorithm? An LLM?

2. Are you a regular user of  LLMs?

3. Do you play with LLM properties when using them? For instance, do you change the model temperature?

4. Have you already installed an LLM in an on-premise infrastructure?

5. Can you provide an example of a challenge you encounter when working with LLMs?

### Questions asked during "Requirements Definition"
1. What should a viable solution comprise?

2. Which solution characteristics would convince you the solution is feasible?

3. Which solution characteristics would convince you the solution is practical?

4. Which solution characteristics would convince you to adopt this solution in replacement of the current one?

Considering a feasible AI-based solution to the selected problem using LLMs:

1. Which functional requirements do you consider essential?

2. Which functional requirements would be nice to have?

3. Which non-functional requirements do you consider essential? For instance, technical, regulatory, and market standard requirements. 

4. Which non-functional requirements would be nice to have?

5. Which other requirements do you think are necessary?
