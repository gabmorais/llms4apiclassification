"the api is primarily used for retrieving account balances from the national australia bank (nab) central banking system (cbs). it allows for the retrieval of balances for a specified set of accounts, which can then be used to update the account services api's projection store.

the post /retrievebalances endpoint is used to initiate the process of retrieving these balances. this endpoint expects a json payload containing a list of account numbers for which balances are to be retrieved.

here is a simple example of how the json payload might look:

```json
{
  ""accounts"": [
    ""1234567890"",
    ""0987654321""
  ]
}
```

in this example, the api will retrieve the balances for the accounts with the numbers 1234567890 and 0987654321.

the response from this endpoint will be a json object containing the balances for the requested accounts. each account will have a corresponding balance field in the response.

for example:

```json
{
  ""1234567890"": 1000.50,
  ""0987654321"": 500.75
}
```

in this example, the account with the number 1234567890 has a balance of $1,000.50, and the account with the number 0987654321 has a balance of $500.75.
