jpmorgan chase & co. (jpm) has recently been on zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. shares of this largest u.s. bank have returned -10.2% over the past month versus the zacks s&p 500 composite's -6.2% change. the zacks banks - major regional industry, to which jpmorgan chase & co. belongs, has lost 9.6% over this period. now the key question is: where could the stock be headed in the near term? although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. revisions to earnings estimates here at zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. that's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. when earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. and when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. jpmorgan chase & co. is expected to post earnings of $3.77 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.4%. over the last 30 days, the zacks consensus estimate has changed +2.4%. the consensus earnings estimate of $14.80 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.9%. this estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.
